# ideas
My ideas repository is where I share what ideas I have stashed away at the moment for all to see.
The ideas in the repository are either:
- In progress but I don't need to keep them under wraps
- Too complicated for me to build
- Not a priority at the moment
- In need of a partner who can help me build them
- Or not that good or profitable so I don't mind them being taken

## How to get around

Here's how this repository is organized:

1. ideas repository
    1. idea folder
        1. README.md
        2. progress.md

**idea.md**: This is where I describe my idea in detail. I talk about the mechanics of it (if it's a game), what problem is being solved and who is the solution meant for. I also share my methodology or how I plan on building if I decide to work on it.

**progress.md**: This is where I share my progress on the idea if I do end up working on it. The folder may or may not include this file, since I could just share my idea and not work on it at all.

Once I've progressed far enough with an idea, I will be moving the folders to their own repository, so watch [my GitHub account](https://github.com/ghiliweld) for new releases.

## Why am I doing this?
I kinda just felt like doing this :smiley:. However, the more I thought about it, the more I started seeing the benefit in sharing my ideas.

There are a few advantages with sharing my ideas on GitHub:
1. I can get feedback on them and see if there's any flaws in my ideas.
2. I can gauge demand for certain idea if it generates buzz.
3. Prospective employers can see how I think and can learn more about me (kinda like having a blog).
4. I might be able to find a partner to work on the idea with me if they see this and are interested in working with me.

Not all of my ideas are here. The really good ones that I'm working on are obviously hidden until I'm ready to announce them.

Feel free to take any of my ideas and build them if you want. All I ask is that you **let me know first**(We might be able to work together on it) and **give me credit**.
