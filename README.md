# ideas
My ideas repository is where I share what ideas I have stashed away at the moment for all to see.
The ideas in the repository are either:
- Too complicated for me to build
- Not a priority at the moment
- In need of a partner who can help me build them
- Or not that good or profitable so I don't mind them being taken

Not all of my ideas are here. The really good ones that I'm working that stand to make a lot of money are obviously hidden until I'm ready to announce them.

Feel free to take any of my ideas and build on them if you want. All that I ask is that you **let me know first**(We might be able to work together on it) and **give me credit**.
