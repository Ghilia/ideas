## Summary + Vision:
**A place where great minds can converge**. A center that offers office space for startups (maybe even seed investments if possible), monthly conferences and workshops given by experts in the tech industry, computer labs (probably unnecessary) and a cafe for solo builders to sit down and get to work or even network with other builders.

## What Prompted This Idea:
I can't code but I'm currently learning how to. I learn in a rather particular way where I can learn on my own most of the time but 10% of the time I need someone I can turn to and ask quick questions<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. That's why coding workshops and bootcamps are overkill for me. I started wondering what learning would be like if I could just drop by somewhere, sit down and do my work and if I have a questions, consult with an expert who may also be sitting there for a minute. A cafe seemed like an effective place to host a center like this and that's how the concept of hackCenter came to be.

## Challenges:
I describe above the idea of experts just somehow being there and helping out newbies out of the goodness of their hearts but that's not very realistic. The main challenge that needs to be addressed is what incentive can we give for experts to sit in the cafe and help out learning devs. One incentive I came up with was the right to allow them to give as many presentation as they want in order to cement themselves as authorities in the space. Conferences, presentations and workshops can charge for entries, therefore the revenue would be split between hackCenter (not for profit but for maintenance costs) and the presenters. This, in my opinion, would be proper compensation for being present and helping out the community.

### Footnotes:
<a name="1">1</a>: I realize not everybody learns like this but that's not the point. This autodidact+tutoring learning method is not for everyone since some people do better in a school-like environment a la coding bootcamp, however I am attempting to scratch my own itch(and I'm sure many prefer this method too) so I will not be taking that into account.
